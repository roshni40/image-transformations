#Geometric Transformations in Python

This repository demonstrates 2D geometric transformations on both numeric points and images using NumPy, Matplotlib, and OpenCV.

#Implemented Transformations:

Translation – shifting objects

Rotation – rotating around a point

Euclidean – rotation + translation

Similarity – rotation + uniform scaling + translation

Affine – general linear transformations (shear, non-uniform scaling)

Projective (Homography) – perspective distortions

#Features:

Apply transformations on numeric coordinates (square, polygons, etc.)

Visualize original vs transformed shapes using Matplotlib

Apply transformations to real images with OpenCV

This project is useful for computer vision, image processing, and geometry learning.
